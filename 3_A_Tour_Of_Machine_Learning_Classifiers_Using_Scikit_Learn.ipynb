To restate the No Free Lunch theorem by David H. Wolpert, no single classifier works best across all posible scenarios. In practice, it is always recommended that you compare the performance of at least a handful of different learning algorithms to select the best model for the particular problem; these may differ in the number of features or samples, the amount of noise in the dataset, and whether the class is linearly separable or not.

    "Although the perceptron rule offers a nice and easygoing introduction to machine learning algorithms for classification, its biggest disadvantage is that it never converges if the class are not perfectly linearly separable. The classification task in the previous section would be an example of such a scenario, Intuitively, we can think of the reason as the weights are continuously being updated since there is always at least one misclassified sample present in each epoch. Of course, you can change the learning rate and increase the number of epochs, but be warned that the perceptron will never converge on this dataset. To make better use of our time, we will now take a look at another simple yet more powerfull algorithm for linear and binary classification problems: **logistic regression**. Note that, in spite of its name, logistic regression is a model for classification, not regression. "

    "Logistic regression is a classification model that is very easy to implement but performs very well on linearly separable classes. It is one of the most widely used algorithms for classification in industry. Similar to the perceptron and Adaline, the logistic regression model in this chapter is also a linear model for binary classification that can be extended to multiclass classification, for example, via the OvR technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain the idea behind logistic regression as a probabilistic model, let's first introduce the **odds ratio**: the odds in favor of a particular event. The odds ratio can be written as $\\frac{p}{1-p}$ where $p$ stands for the probability of the positive event. The term *positive event* does not necessarily mean *good*, but refers to the event that we can want to predict, for example, the probability that a patient has a certain disease; we can think of the positive event as class label $y = 1$. We can then further define the *logit* function, which is simply the logarithm of the odds ratio (log-odds): \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{logit}(p) = \\log\\frac{p}{(1-p)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that *log* refers to the natural logarithm, as it is the common convention in computer science. The *logit* function takes as input values in the range 0 to 1 and transforms them to values over the entire real-number range, which we can use to express a linear relationship between feature values and the log-odds: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{logit}(p(y = 1 | x)) = w_0x_0 + w_1x_1 + ... + w_mx_m = \\sum_{i=0}^{m}w_ix_i = w^Tx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $p(y = 1 | x)$ is the condition probability that a particular sample belongs to class 1 given its features $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are actually interested in predicting the probability that a certain sample belongs to a particular class, which is the inverse form of the *logit* function. It is also called **logistic sigmoid function**, sometimes simply abbreviated to **sigmoid function** due to its characteristic S-shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $z$ is the net input, the linear combination of weights and sample features, $z = w^Tx = w_0x_0 + w_1x_1 + ... + w_mx_m$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $w_0$ refers to the bias unit, and is an additional input value that we provide $x_0$, which is set equal to 1. "

    "We can see that $\\phi(z)$ approaches 1 if $z$ goes towards infinity ($z \\to \\infty$ since $e^{-z}$ becomes very small for large values of z. Similarly, $\\phi(z)$ goes towards 0 for $z \\to -\\infty$ as a result of an increasingly large denominator. Thus, we conclude that this sigmoid function takes real number values as input and transform them into values in the range [0, 1] with an intercept at $\\phi(z)=0.5$. \n",

    "To build some intuition for the logistic regression model, we can relate it to previous chapter. In Adaline, we used the identity function $\\phi(z) = z$ as the activation function. In logistic regression, this activation function simply becomes the sigmoid function that we defined earlier. The difference between Adaline and logistic regression is illustrated in the following figure: \n",

    "The output of the sigmoid function is then interpreted as the probability of a particular sample belonging to class 1, $\\phi(z) = P(y = 1 | x;w)$, given its features $x$ parameterized by the weights $w$. For example, if we compute $\\phi(z) = 0.8$ for a particular flower sample, it means that the chance that this sample is an *Iris-versicolor* flower is 80 percent. Therefore, the probability that this flower is an *Iris-setosa* flower can be calculated as $P(y = 0 | x;w) = 1 - P(y = 1 | x;w) = 0.2$ or 20 percent. The predicted probability can then simply be converted into a binary outcome via a threshold function:\n",

    "In fact, there are many applications where we are not only interested in the predicted class labels, but where the estimation of the class-memberships probability is particularly useful (the output of the sigmoid function prior to applying the threshold function). Logistic regression is used in weather forecasting, for example, not only to predict if it will rain on a particular day but also to report the chance of rain. Similarly, logistic regression can be used to predict the chance that a patient has a particular disease given certain symptoms, which is why logistic regression enjoys great popularity in the field of medicine.
