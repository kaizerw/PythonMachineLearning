    "TensorFlow can speep up our machine learning tasks significantly. To understand how it can do this, let's begin by discussing some of the performance challenges we typically run into when we run expensive calculations on our hardware. \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of computer processors has, of course, been improving continuously over recent years, and that has allowed us to train more powerful and complex learning systems, and so to improve the predictive performance of our machine learning models. Even the cheapest desktop computer hardware that is available right now comes with processing units that have multiple cores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in the previous chapter, we saw that many functions in scikit-learn allowed us to spread those computations over multiple processing units. However, by default, Python is limited to execution on one core due to the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**. So, although we, indeed, take advantage of its multiprocessing library to distribute our computations over multiple cores, we still have to consider that the most advanced desktop hardware rarely comes with more than 8 or 16 such cores. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we recall from the previous chapter, where we implemented a very simple multilayer perceptron with only one hidden layer consisting of 100 units, we had to optimize approximately 80,000 weight parameters ([784\\*100 + 100] + [100 \\* 10] + 10 = 79,510) to learn a model for a very simple image classification task. The images in MNIST are rather small (28 x 28 pixels), and we can only imagine the explosion in the number of parameters if we want to add additional hidden layers or work with images that have higher pixel densities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such a task would quickly become unfeasible for a single processing unit. The question then becomes - how can we tackle such problems more effectively?\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious solution to this problem is to use GPUs, which are real work horses. You can think of a graphics card as a small computer cluster inside your machine. Another advantage is that modern GPUs are relatively cheap compared to the state-of-the-art CPUs, as we can see in the following overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/13_05.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "At 70 percent of the price of a modern CPU, we can get a GPU that has 450 times more cores and is capable of around 15 times more floating-point calculations per second. So, what is holding us back from utilizing GPUs for our machine learning tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that writing code to target GPU is not as simple as executing Python code in our interpreter. There are special packages, such as CUDA and OpenCL, that allows us to target the GPU. However, writing code in CUDA or OpenCL is probably not the most convenient environment for implementing and running machine learning algorithms. The good news is that this is what TensorFlow was developed for!"

    "TensorFlow was developed by the researchers and engineers of the Google Brain team; and while the main development is led by a team of researchers and software engineers at Google, its development also involves many contributions from the open source community. TensorFlow was initially built for only internal use at Google, but it was subsequently released in November 2015 under a permissive open source license. \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the performance of training machine learning models, TensorFlow allows execution on both CPUs and GPUs. However, its greatest performance capabilities can be discovered when using GPUs. TensorFlow supports CUDA-enabled GPUs officially. Support for OpenCL-enabled devices is still experimental. However, OpenCL will likely be officially supported in near future. \n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow currently supports frontend interfaces for a number of programming languages. Luckly for us as Python users, TensorFlow's Python API is currently the most complete API, thereby attracting many machine learning and deep learning practitioners. Furthermore, TensorFlow has an official API in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "The APIs in other languages, such as Java, Haskell, Node.js, and Go, are not stable yet, but the open source community and TensorFlow developers are constantly improving them. TensorFlow computations rely on constructing a directed graph for representing the data flow. Even though building the graph may sound complicated, TensorFlow comes with high-level APIs that has made it very easy. "

However, in practice, it would not be very useful to use linear activation functions for both hidden and output layer since we want to introduce nonlinearity in a typical artificial neural network to be able to tackle complex problems. The sum of linear functions yields a linear function after all. \n",

This is why people often prefer a hyperbolic tangent as an activation function in hidden layers. \n",

    "**Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)** is another activation function that is often used in deep neural networks. Before we understand ReLU, we should step back and understand the vanishing gradient problem of tanh and logistic activations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this problem, let's assume that we initially have the net input $z_1 = 20$, which changes to $z_2 = 25$. Computing the tanh activation, we get $\\phi(z_1) \\approx 1.0$ and $\\phi(z_2) \\approx 1.0$, which shows no change in the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means the derivative of activations with respect to net input diminishes as $z$ becomes large. As a result, learning weights during the training phase become very slow because the gradient terms may be very close to zero. ReLU activation addresses this issue. Mathematically, ReLU is defined as follows:\n",

    "$$\\phi(z) = max(0, z)$$\n",

    "ReLU is still a nonlinear function that is good for learning complex functions with neural networks. Besides this, the derivative of ReLU, with respect to its input, is always 1 for positive input values. Therefore, it solves the problem of vanishing gradients, making it suitable for deep neural networks. We will use the ReLU activation function in the next chapter as an activation function for multilayer convolutional neural networks. \n",

    "In this chapter, you learned how to use TensorFlow, an open source library for numerical computations with a special focus on deep learning. While TensorFlow is more convenient to use compared to NumPy, due to its additional complexity to support GPUs, it allows us to define and train large, multilayer neural networks very efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you learned about the TensorFlow API to build complex machine learning and neural network models and run them efficiently. First, we explored programming in the low-level TensorFlow API. Implementing model at this level may be tedious when we have to program at the level of matrix-vector multiplications and define every detail of each operation. However, the advantage is that this allows us as developers to combine such basic operations and build more complex models. Furthermore, we discussed how TensorFlow allows us to utilize the GPUs for training and testing big neural networks to speed up the computations. Without the use of GPUs, training some networks would typically need months of computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then explored two high-level APIs that make building neural network models a lot easier compared to the low-level API. Specifically, we used TensorFlow Layers and Keras to build the multilayer neural network and learned how to build models using those APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you learned about different activation functions and understood their behaviors and applications. Specifically, in this chapter, we saw tanh, softmax, and ReLU. In previous chapter, we started with implementing a simple **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** to classify a handwritten image in the MNIST dataset. While the low-level implementation from scratch was helpful to illustrate the core concepts of a multilayer neural network, such as the forward pass and backpropagation, training neural networks using NumPy is very inefficient and impractical for large networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we wil continue our journey and dive deeper into TensorFlow, and we will find ourselves working with graph and session objects. Along the way, we will learn many new concepts, such as placeholders, variables, and saving and restoring models in TensorFlow. "
