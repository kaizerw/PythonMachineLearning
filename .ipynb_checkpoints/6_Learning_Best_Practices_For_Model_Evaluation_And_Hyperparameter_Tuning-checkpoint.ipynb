Let's assume that we fit our model on training dataset and use the same data to estimate how well it performs on new data. We remember that a model can either suffer from underfitting (high bias) if the model is too simple, or it can overfit the training data (high variance) if the model is too complex for the underlying training data. \n",

In this section, you will learn about the common cross-validation techniques **holdout cross-validation** and **k-fold cross-validation**, which can help us obtain reliable estimates of the model's generalization performance, that is, how well the model performs on unseen data.

   "source": [
    "A classic and popular approach for estimating the generalization performance of machine learning models is holdout cross-validation. Using the holdout method, we split our initial dataset into a separate training and test dataset, the former is used for model training, and the latter is used to estimate its generalization performance. However, in typical machine learning applications, we are also interested in tuning and comparing different parameter settings to further improve the performance for making predictions on unseen data. This process is called **model selection**, where the term model selection refers to a given classification problem for which we want to select the *optimal* values of tuning parameters (also called hyperparameters). However, if we reuse the same test dataset over and over again during the model selection, it will become part of our training data and thus the model will be more likely to overfit. Despite this issue, many people still use the test set for model selection, which is not a good machine learning practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "A better way of using the holdout method for model selection is to separate the data into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to fit the different models, and the performance on the validation set is then used for the model selection. The advantage of having a test set that the model has not seen before during the training and model selection steps is that we can obtain a less biased estimate of its ability to generalize to new data. The following figure illustrates the concept of holdout cross-validation, where we use a validation set to repeatedly evaluate the performance of the model after training using different parameter values. Once we are satisfied with the tuning of hyperparameter values, we estimate the model's generalization performance on the test dataset: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/06_02.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of the holdout method is that the performance estimate may be very sensitive to how we partition the training set into the training and validation subsets; the estimate will vary for different samples of the data. In the next subsection, we will take a look at a more robust technique for performance estimation, **k-fold cross validation**, where we repeat the holdout method *k* times on *k*-subsets of the training data.

    "In k-fold cross-validation, we randomly split the training dataset into *k* folds without replacement, where $k-1$ folds are used for the model training, and one fold is used for performance evaluation. This procedure is repeated *k* times so that we obtain *k* models and performance estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then calculate the average performance of the models based on the different, independent folds to obtain a performance estimate that is less sensitive to the sub-partitioning of the training data compared to the holdout method. Typically, we use k-fold cross-validation for model tuning, that is, findind the optimal hyperparameter values that yields a satisfying generalization performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have found satisfactory hyperparameter values, we can retrain the model on the complete training set and obtain a final performance estimate using the independent test set. The rationale behind fitting a model to the whole training dataset after k-fold cross-validation is that providing more training samples to a learning algorithm usually results in a more accurate and robust model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since k-fold cross-validation is a resampling technique without replacement, the advantage of this approach is that each sample point will be used for training and validation (as part of a test fold) exactly once, which yields a lower-variance estimate of the model performance than the holdout method. The following figure summarizes the concept behind k-fold cross validation with $k=10$. The training dataset is divided into 10 folds, and during the 10 iterations, nine folds are used for training, and one fold will be used as the test set for the model evaluation. Also, the estimated performances $E_i$ (for example, classification accuracy or error) for each fold are then used to calculate the estimated average performance $E$ of the model: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/06_03.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "A good standard value for $k$ in k-fold cross-validation is 10, as empirical evidence showns. For instance, experiments by Ron Kohavi on various real-world datasets suggests that 10-fold cross-validation offers the best trade-off between bias and variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we are working with relatively small training sets, it can be useful to increase the number of folds. If we increase the value of $k$, more training data will be used in each iteration, which results in a lower bias towards estimating the generalization performance by averaging the individual model estimates. However, large values of $k$ will also increase the runtime of the cross-validation algorithm and yield estimates with higher variance, since the training folds will be more similar to each other. On the other hand, if we are working with large datasets, we can choose a small value of $k$, for example, $k=5$, and still obtain an accurate estimate of the average performance of the model while reducing the computational cost of refitting and evaluating the model on different folds. \n",
    "\n",
    "A special case of k-fold cross-validation is the **Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)** method. In LOOCV, we set the number of folds equal to the number of training samples ($k = n$) so that only training sample is used for testing during each iteration, which is a recommended approach for working with very small datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "A slight improvement over the standard k-fold cross-validation approach is stratified k-fold cross-validation, which can yield better bias and variance estimates, especially in cases of unequal class proportions. In stratified cross-validation, the class proportions are preserved in each fold to ensure that each fold is representative of the class proportions in the training dataset, which we will illustrate by using the *StratifiedKFold* iterator in scikit-learn: "

    "Via the *train_sizes* parameter in the *learning_curve* function, we can control the absolute or relative number of training samples that are used to generate the learning curves. Here, we set *train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10)* to use 10 evenly spaced, relative intervals for the training set sizes. By default, the *learning_curve* function uses stratified k-fold cross-validation to calculate the cross-validation accuracy of a classifier, and we set $k=10$ via the *cv* parameter for 10-fold stratified cross-validation. Then, we simply calculated the average accuracies from the returned cross-validated training and set scores for the different sizes of the training set, which we plotted using Matplotlib's *plot* function. Furthermore, we added the standard deviation of the average accuracy to the plot using the *fill_between* function to indicate the variance of the estimate. \n",

    "As we can see in the preceding learning curve plot, our model performs quite well on both the training and validation datasets if it had seen more than 250 samples during training. We can also see that the training accuracy increases for training sets with fewer than 250 samples, and the gap between validation and training accuracy widens, an indicator of an increasing degree of overfitting.

    "Validation curves are a useful tool for improving the performance of a model by addressing issues such as overfitting and underfitting. Validation curves are related to learning curves, but instead of plotting the training and test accuracies as functions of the sample size, we vary the number of the model parameters, for example, the inverse regularization parameter *C* in logistic regression. Let's go ahead and see how we create validation curves via scikit-learn: "

    "Similar to the *learning_curve* function, the *validation_curve* function uses stratified k-fold cross-validation by default to estimate the performance of the classifier. Inside the *validation_curve* function, we specified the parameter that we wanted to evaluate. In this case, it is *C*, the inverse regularization parameter of the *LogisticRegression* classifier, which we wrote as *'logisticregression__C'* to access the *LogisticRegression* object inside the scikit-learn pipeline for a specified value range that we set via the *param_range* parameter. Similar to the learning curve example in the previous section, we plotted the average training and cross-validation accuracies and the corresponding standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the differences in the accuracy for varying values of *C* are subtle, we can see that the model slightly underfits the data when we increase the regularization strength (small values of *C*). However, for large values of *C*, it means lowering the strength of regularization, so the model tends to slightly overfit the data. In this case, the sweet pot appears to be between 0.01 and 0.1 of the *C* value. "
