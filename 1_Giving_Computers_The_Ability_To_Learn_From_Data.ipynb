For instance, in chess the outcome of each move can be thought of as a different state of the environment. To explore the chess example further, let's think of visiting certain locations on the chess board  as being associated with a positive event, for instance, removing an opponent's chess piece from the board or threatening the queen. Other positions, however, are associated with a negative event, such as losing a chess piece to the opponent in the following turn. Now, not every turn results in the removal of a chess piece, and reinforcement learning is concerned with learning the series of steps by maximizing a reward based on immediate and delayed feedback.

Thus, **the preprocessing of the data is one of the most crucial steps in any machine learning application**. If we take the Iris flower dataset from the previous section as an example, we can think of the raw data as a series of flower images from which we want to extract meaningful features. Useful features could be the color, the hue, the intensity of the flowers, the height, and the flower lenghts and widths. **Many machine learning algorithms also require that the selected features are on the same scale for optimal performance**, which is often achieved by transforming the features in the range [0, 1], or a **standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance**, as we will see in later chapters.

An important point that can be summarized from David Wolpert's famous **No free lunch theorems** is that we can't get learning for free. Intuitively, we can relate this concept to the popular saying, **_I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail_**. For example, **each classification algorithm has its inherent biases, and no single classification model enjoys superiority if we do not make any assumptions about the task**. In practice, it is therefore essential to compare at least a handful of different algorithms in order to train and select the best performing model. But before we can compare different models, we first have to decide upon a metric to measure performance. One commonly used metric is classification **accuracy**, which is defined as **the proportion of correctly classified instances**. "

Finally, **we also cannot expect that the default parameters of the different learning algorithms provided by the software libraries are optimal for our specific problem task**. Therefore, we will make frequent use of **hyperparameter optimization techniques** that help us to **fine-tune the performance of our model** in later chapters.
