    "Training a machine learning model can be computationally quite expensive, as we have seen previously. Surely we do not want to train our model every time we close our Python interpreter and want to make a new prediction or reload our web application? One option for model persistence is Python's in-built *pickle* module, which allows us to serialize and deserialize Python object structures to compact bytecode so that we can save our classifier in its current state and reload it if we want to classify new samples, without needing the model to learn from the training data all over again. Before you execute the following code, please make sure that you have trained the out-of-core logistic regression model from the last section of the previous chapter and have it ready in your current Python session: "

    "While our predictive model is updated on the fly whenever a user provides feedback about the classification, the updates to the *clf* object will be reset if the web server crashes or restarts. If we reload the web application, the *clf* object will be reinitialized from the *classifier.pkl* pickle file. One option to apply the updates permanently would be to pickle the *clf* object once again after each update. However, this would become computationally very inefficient with a growing number of users, and could corrupt the pickle file if users provide feedback simultaneously. \n",

    "An alternative solution is to update the predictive model from the feedback data that is being collected in the SQLite database. One option would be to download the SQLite database from the PythonAnywhere server, update the *clf* object locally on our computer, and upload the new pickle file to PythonAnywhere. To update the classifier locally on our computer, we create an *update.py* script file in the *movieclassifier* directory with the following contents:"

    "In this chapter, you learned about many useful and practical topics that extend our knowledge of machine learning theory. You learned how to serialize a model after training and how to load it for later use cases. Furthermore, we created a SQLite database for efficient data storage and created a web application that let us make our movie classifier available to the outside world. \n",
