    "At the beginning of this book, we started our journey through machine learning algorithms with artificial neurons. Artificial neurons represent the building blocks of the multilayer artificial neural networks that we will discuss in this chapter. The basic concept behind artificial neural networks was built upon hypothesis and models of how the human brain works to solve complex problem tasks. Although artificial neural networks have gained a lot of popularity in recent years, early studies of neural networks go back to the 1940s when Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitt first described how neurons could work. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the decades that followed the first implementation of the **McCulloch-Pitt neuron** model - Rosenblatt's perceptron in the 1950s, many researchers and machine learning practitioners slowly began to lose interest in neural networks since no one had a good solution for training a neural network with multiple layers. Eventually, interest in neural networks was rekindled in 1986 when D.E. Rumelhart, G.E. Hinton, and R.J. Williams were involved in the (red)discovery and popularization of the backpropagation algorithm to train neural networks more efficiently, which we will discuss in more detail later in this chapter. Readers who are interested in the history of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, machine learning, and neural networks are also encouraged to read the Wikipedia article on *AI winter*, which are periods of time where a large portion of the research community lost interest in the study of neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, neural networks have never been as popular as they are today, thanks to the many major breakthroughs that have been made in the previous decade, which resulted in what we now call deep learning algorithms and architectures - neural networks that are composed of many layers. Neural networks are a hot topic not only in academic research but also in big technology companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, and Google, who invest heavily in artificial neural networks and deep learning research. As of today, complex neural networks powered by deep learning algorithms are considered state of the art when it comes to complex problem solving such as image and voice recognition. Popular examples of the products in our everyday life that are powered by deep learning are Google's image search and Google Translate - an application for smartphones than can automatically recognize text in images for real-time translation into more than 20 languages. \n",

    "This chapter is all about multilayer neural networks, how they work, and how to train them to solve complex problems. However, before we dig deeper into a particular multilayer neural network architecture, let's briefly reiterate some of the concepts of single-layer neural networks that we introduced in the beginning of this book, namely, the **ADAptive LInear NEuron (Adaline)** algorithm, which is shown is the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/12_01.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we implemented the Adaline algorithm to perform binary classification, and we used the gradient descent optimization algorithm to learn the weight coefficients of the model. In every epoch (pass over the training set), we updated the weight vector $w$ using the following update rule: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$w := w + \\Delta w, \\text{where} \\Delta w = \\eta J(w)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we computed the gradient based on the whole training set and updated the weights of the model by taking a step into the opposite direction of the gradient $J(w)$. In order to find the optimal weights of the model, we optimized an objective function that we defined as the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** cost function $J(w)$. Furthermore, we multiplied the gradient by a factor, the learning rate $\\eta$, which we had to choose carefully to balance the speed of learning against the risk of overshooting the global minimum of the cost function. \n",
    "\n",
    "In gradient descent optimization, we updated all weights simultaneously after each epoch, and we defined the partial derivative for each weight $w_j$ in the weight vector $w$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_j}J(w) = -\\sum_i{y^{(i)} - a^{(i)}}x^{(i)}_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $y^{(i)}$ is the target class label of a particular sample $x^{(i)}$, and $a^{(i)}$ is the activation of the neuron, which is a linear function in the special case of Adaline. Furthermore, we defined the activation function $\\phi$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(z) = z = a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the net input $z$ is a linear combination of the weights that are connecting the input to the output layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\sum_j w_jx_j = w^Tx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While we used the activation $\\phi(z)$ to compute the gradient update, we implemented a threshold function to squash the continuous valued output into binary class labels for prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ŷ = 1 \\, \\text{if} \\, g(z) \\ge 0; -1 \\, \\text{otherwise}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that although Adaline consists of two layers, one input layer and one output layer, it is called single-layer network because of its single link between the input and output layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we learned about a certain trick to accelerate the model training, the so-called **stochastic gradient descent** optimization. Stochastic gradient descent approximates the cost from a single training sample (online learning) or a small subset of training samples (mini-batch learning). We will make use of this concept later in this chapter when we implement and train a multilayer perceptron. Apart from faster learning - due to the more frequent weight updates compared to gradient descent - its noisy nature is also regarded as beneficial when training multilayer neural networks with non-linear activation functions, which do not have a convex cost function. Here, the added noise can help to escape local cost minima, but we will discuss this topic in more detail later in this chapter."

    "In this section, you will learn how to connect multiple single neurons to a multilayer feedforward neural network; this special type of *fully connected* network is also called **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**. The following picture illustrates the concept of an MLP consisting of three layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/12_02.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLP depicted in the preceding figure has one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer. The units in the hidden layear are fully connected to the input layer. If such a network has more than one hidden layer, we also call it a **deep artificial neural network**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can add an arbitrary number of hidden layers to the MLP to create deeper network architectures. Practically, we can think of the number of layers and units in a neural network as additional hyperparameters that we want to optimize for a given problem task using cross-validation techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the error gradients that we will calculate later via backpropagation will become increasingly small as more layers are added to a network. This vanishing gradient problem makes the model learning more challenging. Therefore, special algorithms have been developed to help train such deep neural network structures; this is known as **deep learning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the preceding figure, we denote the *i*th activation unit in the *l*th layer as $a_i^{(l)}$. To make the math and code implementations a bit more intuitive, we will not use numerical indices to refer to layers, but we will use the *in* superscript for the input layer, the *h* superscript for the hidden layer, and the *out* superscript for the output layer. For instance, $a_i^{(in)}$ refers to the *i*th value in the input layer, $a_i^{(h)}$ refers to the *i*th unit in the hidden layer, adn $a_i^{(out)}$ refers to the *i*th unit in the output layer. Here, the activation unit $a_0^{(in)}$ and $a_0^{(h)}$ are the **bias units**, which we set equal to 1. The activation of the units in the input layer is just its input plus the unit bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later in this chapter, we will implement the multilayer perceptron using separate vectors for the bias unit, which makes the code implementation more efficient and easier to read. This concept is also used by TensorFlow, a deep learning library that we will introduce later. However, the mathematical equations that will follow, would appear more complex or convoluted if we had to work with additional variables for the bias. However, note that the computation via appending 1s to the input vector (as shown previously) and using a weight variable as bias is exactly the same as operating with separate bias vectors; it is merely a different convention. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit in layer *l* is connected to all units in layer $l+1$ vi a weight coefficient. For example, the connection between the $k$th unit in the layer $l$ to the $j$th unit in layer $l+1$ will be written as $w_{k,j}^{l}$. Referring back to the previous figure, we denote the weight matrix that connects the input to the hidden layer as $W^{(h)}$, and write the matrix that connects the hidden layer to the output layer as $W^{(out)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "While one unit in the output layer would suffice for a binary classification task, we saw a more general form of neural network in the preceding figure, which allows us to perform multiclass classification via a generalization of the **One-versus-all (OvA)** technique. To better understand how this works, remember the one-hot representation of categorical variables. For example, we can encode the three class labels in the familiar Iris dataset (0=setosa, 1=versicolor, 2=virginica) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = [1, 0, 0], 1 = [0, 1, 0], 2 = [0, 0, 1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This one-hot vector representation allows us to tackle classification tasks with an arbitrary number of unique class labels present in the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to neural network representations, the indexing notation (subscripts and superscripts) may look a little bit confusing at first. What may seem overly complicated at first will make much more sense in later section when we vectorize the neural network representation. As introduced earlier, we summarize the weights that connect the input and hidden layers by a matrix $w^{(h)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$, where $d$ is te number of hidden units and $m$ is the number of input units including the bias unit. Since it is important to internalize this notation to follow the concepts later in this chapter, let's summarize what we have just learned in a descriptive illustration of a simplified 3-4-3 multilayer perceptron: \n",

    "In this section, we will describe the process of **forward propagation** to calculate the output of an MLP model. To understand how it fits into the context of learning an MLP model, let's summarize the MLP learning procedure in three simple steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting at the input layer, we forward propagate the patterns of the training data through the network to generate an output. \n",
    "2. Based on the network's output, we calculate the error that we want to minimize using a cost function that we will describe later. \n",
    "3. We backpropagate the error, find its derivative with respect to each weight in the network, and update the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after we repeat these three steps for multiple epochs and learn the weights of the MLP, we use forward backpropagation to calculate the network output and apply a threshold function to obtain the predicted class labels in the one-hot representation, which we described in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's walk through the individual steps of forward propagation to generate an output from the patters in the training data. Since each unit in the hidden layer is connected to all units in the input layers, we first calculate the activation unit of the hidden layer $a_l^{(h)}$ as follows:\n",

    "Here, $z_1^{(h)}$ is the net input and $\\phi$ is the activation function, which has to be differentiable to learn the weights that connect the neurons using a gradient-based approach. To be able to solve complex problem such as image classification, we need non-linear activation functions in our MLP model, for example, the sigmoid (logistic) activation function that we remember from the section about logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src='images/12_04.png'>\n",

    "MLP is a typical example of a feedforward artificial neural network. The term **feedforward** refers to the fact that each layer serves as the input to the next layer without loops, in contrast to recurrent neural network - an architecture that we will discuss later in this chapter and discuss in more detail in the last chapter of this book. The term *multilayer perceptron* may sound a little bit confusing since the artificial neurons in this network architecture are typically sigmoid units, not perceptrons. Intuitively, we can think of the neurons in the MLP as logistic regression units that return values in the continuous range between 0 and 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "For purposes of code efficiency and readability, we will now write the activation in a more compact form using the concepts of basic linear algebra, which will allow us to vectorize our code implementation via NumPy rather than writing multiple nested and computationally expensive Python *for* loops: \n",

After matrix-vector multiplication, we obtain the $l \\times d$ dimensional net input $z^{(h)}$ to calculate the activation $a^{(h)}$ (where $a^{(h)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{l \\times d}$). Furthermore, we can generalize this computation to all $n$ samples in the training set: \n",

Further, instead of using *savez*, we will use *savez_compressed*, which uses the same syntax as *savez*, but further compresses the output file down to substantially smaller file sizes.

    "Note that this example was chosen deliberately to illustrate the effect of overfitting and demonstrate why it is useful to compare the validation and training accuracy values during training. One way to decrease the effect of overfitting is to increase the regularization strength - for example, by setting *l2=0.1*. Another useful technique to tackle overfitting in neural networks, dropout, will be covered later. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, I intend to provide a short and intuitive summary and the bigger picture of how this fascinating algorithm works before we dive into more mathematical details. In essence, we can think of backpropagation as a very computationally efficient approach to compute the partial derivatives of a complex cost function in multilayer neural networks. Here, our goal is to use those derivatives to learn the weight coefficients for parametrizing such a multilayer artificial neural network. The challenge in the parametrization of neural networks is that we are typically dealing with a very large number of weight coefficients in a high-dimensional feature space. In contrast to cost functions of single-layer neural networks such as Adaline or logistic regression, which we have seen in previous chapter, the error surface of a neural network cost function is not convex or smooth with respect to the parameters. There are many bumps in this high-dimensional cost surface (local minima) that we have to overcome in order to find the global minimum of the cost function. \n",

    "You may recall the concept of the chain rule from your introductory calculus. The chain rule is an approach to compute the derivative of a complex, nested, function, such as $f(g(x))$. In the context of computer algebra, a set of techniques has been developed to solve such problems very efficiently, which is also known as **automatic differentiation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation comes with two modes, the forward and reverse modes; backpropagation is simply just a special case of reverse mode automatic differentiation. The key point is that applying the chain rule in the forward mode can be quite expensive since we would have to multiply large matrices for each layer (Jacobians) that we eventually multiply by a vector to obtain the output. The trick of reverse mode is that we start from right to left: we multiply a matrix by a vector, which yields another vector that is multiplied by the next matrix and so on. Matrix-vector multiplication is computationally much cheaper than matrix-matrix multiplication, which is why backpropagation is one of the most popular algorithms used in neural network training. "

Now, we will see how the backpropagation algorithm works to update the weights in our MLP model from a mathematical perspective, which we implemented in the *# Backpropagation* section inside the *fit* method. As we recall from the beginning of this chapter, we first need to apply forward propagation in order to obtain the activation of the output layer, which we formulated as follows:\n",

In the preceding equation, we used the transpose $(W^{(out)})^T$ of the $h \\times t$-dimensional matrix $W^{(out)}$. Here, $t$ is the number of output class labels and $h$ is the number of hidden units. The matrix multiplication between the $n \\times t$-dimensional $\\delta^{(out)}$ matrix and the $t \\times h$-dimensional matrix $(W^{(out)})^T$, results in an $n \\times t$-dimensional matrix that we multiplied elementwise by the sigmoid derivative of the same dimension to obtain the $n \\times t$-dimensional matrix $\\delta^{(h)}$.

    "You might be wondering why we did not use regular gradient descent but instead used mini-batch learning to train our neural network for the handwrittten digit classification. You may recall our discussion on stochastic gradient descent that we used to implement online learning. In online learning, we compute the gradient based on a single training sample ($k=1$) at a time to perform the weight update. Although this is a stochastic approach, it often leads to very accurate solutions with a much faster convergence than regular gradient descent. Mini-batch learning is a special form of stochastic gradient descent where we compute the gradient based on a subset $k$ of the $n$ training samples with $l < k < n$. Mini-batch learning has the advantage over online learning that we can make use of our vectorized implementations to improve computational efficiency. However, we can update the weights much faster than in regular gradient descent. Intuitively, you can think of mini-batch learning as predicting the voter turnout of a presidential election from a poll asking only a representative subset of the population rather than asking the entire population (which would be equal to running to actual election). \n",

By increasing the learning rate, we can more readily escape such local minima. On the other hand, we also increase the chance of overshooting the global optimum if the learning rate is too large. Since we initialize the weights randomly, we start with a solution to the optimization problem that is typically hopelessly wrong. "
